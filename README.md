Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
1.	Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to show how to sort data by adding filters that allows for better analyzing of data. 
2.	Analysis and Challenges: Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.
The first exercise in the Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart was much easier than the second exercise. My challenge came with the Fields in the Pivot Chart. I did not see or understand how to include such fields such as “successful”, “failed” and “canceled”. After watching a couple of videos via LinkedIn learning, I figured out how to get them and was able to complete this portion of the assignment. 
The second exercise was extremely difficult for me as I spent a couple of days and many hours trying to understand how to use the COUNTERIFS formula. I kind of understood it but was unable to complete the second as required. I was in some ways able to extract some information from the given chart and from attempting to use the formula but was/am not confident and decided to stop.

3.	Results: Answer the following questions in complete and coherent sentences.
•	 What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
I really don’t know how to read this column.

•	What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on the data, I conclude that Theater Outcomes by the Launch Date was very successful in all of the countries the play was presented in. The play was most successful in the United States.

•	What are some limitations of this dataset?
I believe based on the data presented there are too many random blurbs that are seemingly unnecessary, otherwise I don’t know.

•	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Tables
1.	One variable data table
2.	Two variable data table

Graphs
1.	 Bar Graph
2.	 Line Graph
3.	 Stacked Line Bar Graph
4.	Line with Markers Graph
